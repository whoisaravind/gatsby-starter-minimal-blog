  Hi.
</Text>

I am Aravindhan - A pre-final year Integrated BBA - MBA student with dual specialization in Finance & Marketing at LPU, Punjab.

I work as a Market Research Intern at Razorpay in the FashionTV at the business vertical of [FTVSOPA] (https://ftvschoolofperformingarts.in/) in the marketing team.

I have previously worked as a Management Intern at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. 

At college, I used to lead the Business team and was a venue coordinator at LPUâ€™s biggest cultural event, [One India One World] (https://www.lpude.in/events/one-india.php).

Prior to that was scaling the management vertical of [Spic Macay] (https://spicmacaylpu.wixsite.com/website). 

I spend my time reading, [writing] (https://medium.com/@aravindnk), and [tweeting] (https://twitter.com/whoisAravind).

When I am not doing the above, I can be found vibing to my [Spotify playlist] (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5lNRMiyfqXhyQPyaXLPNGp?si=c2bc1bd3617a40d2) or exploring No-Code.
